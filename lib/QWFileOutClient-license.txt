The QWIDS product does not contain any proprietary components that require
licensing if used for non-commercial use and is entirely open source. It uses
the free OpenORB Java-based CORBA engine
(found at http://openorb.sourceforge.net) for the framework of the server and
clients using persistent connection push modes. For the storage of persistent
client login information it uses the MySQL database engine, which is free for
non-commercial use (see http://www.mysql.com for licensing terms). On the
publisher and subscriber side IDLs, the open source, C++-based TAO CORBA engine
has been used successfully to interface C-based programs with the QWServer
modules. The C++ TAO CORBA engine is free for any usage, commercial or
non-commercial.

ISTI provides the source code for all its components for free non-commercial
usage with any delivery of the QWIDS product and thus it is an open-source
product. ISTI has copyrighted the source code for the QWServer and all of its
components that were developed by ISTI with ISTI funding. ISTI has developed
several of the plug-in and client modules with its own funding and provides
these at no additional cost with source code. In particular, ISTI has developed
the QWViaFile and QWRelay feeder plug-in modules for the QWServer and also the
QW File-Output Delivery Client on its own.  While these are proprietary
components, we will provide these in source-code for free non-commercial usage.

Non-commercial usage in the context of this quote is that the CISN and ANSS can
use the system to deliver any messages to any end-users. Any component of the
system can be used for this message distribution. However, commercial entities
may only use the QWRelayFeeder plug-in for receiving messages through this
system and not for their own internal message distribution.

2018-08-21

1) files in `META-INF/services` have been removed.

2) the class `com/isti/quakewatch/util/QWPasswordUtils.class` has been patched
   to use `java.util.Base64` instead of `sun.misc.BASE64Encoder`:

```
16c16
< import sun.misc.BASE64Encoder;
---
> import java.util.Base64;
104c104
<       return (new BASE64Encoder()).encode(md.digest());
---
>       return (Base64.getEncoder()).encodeToString(md.digest());
```
