	<p><a href="index.html">&laquo; Back to Products Documentation</a></p>


<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The content of a simple text-type product is displayed directly on the event page.
Text may be plain text or HTML markup. However, markup is not validated nor 
reviewed; product producers sending this type of product must take care to
ensure the text content is appropriate.</p>

<p>There are three types of text products: <i>general-text</i>, 
<i>scitech-text</i> and <i>impact-text</i>. The text product-type is determined by 
the content of the <i>code</i> property of the product, where code is associated 
with the <a href="addon.html">addon</a> product. For example, if code = "GeneralMisc",
a <i>general-text</i> product is created, rather than scitech-text or impact-text. 
The <i>text</i> product itself is never created.</p>


<p>In a sense, <i>addon</i> and <i>text</i> can be considered "abstract" 
products having properties that are used by other products, resulting in 
the creation of one of the three concrete text product types. To illustrate,
if an <a href="origin.html">origin</a> product makes use of the 
<i>addon-type</i> and <i>text</i> properties with <i>code</i> = 
"GeneralMisc", then a <i>general-link</i> product will be created in addition 
to origin. This extra link information will then be seen of the Summary page 
for the product.</p>

	<h2>Types</h2>
	<dl>
		<dt>general-text</dt>
		<dd><i>general-text</i> is currently displayed on the Summary page 
		for the event. These products are created when code starts with case

		</dd>
		<br />
		<dt>scitech-text</dt>
		<dd><i>scitech-text</i> is currently displayed on the Technical page 
		for the event. These products are created when code starts with case 
		insensitively: "Energy", "FocalMech", "ncfm" (deprecated, use FocalMech 
		instead), "HistMomentTensor", "FiniteFault", "MomentTensor", "mtensor" 
		(deprecated, use MomentTensor instead), "Phase", "SeisCrossSec", 
		"SeisRecSec", "TravelTimes", "Waveform", "Seismograms", "SciTechMisc".
