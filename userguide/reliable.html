	<h1>Reliable Listener Configuration</h1>
	<p>
		<a href="index.html">&laquo; Back to Documentation</a>
	</p>

	<p>PDL offers several options for more reliable processing of
		notifications and products, but these are not enabled by default and
		require user configuration.</p>

	<h2>Listener configuration</h2>
	<p>It is recommended that users configure a listenerIndex,
		maxTries, and retryDelay, for each listener to ensure it reliably
		receives and processes notifications of new products.</p>

	<h3>listenerIndex</h3>
	<p>Note: while this is effective in reprocessing notifications that
		failed the first time, it requires a process restart</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>listenerIndex</dt>
		<dd>a notification index specific to a listener, that is used to
			keep track of notifications that have been successfully processed</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>At process start, when a listener has a listenerIndex
		configured, each notification receiver will requeue all notifications
		it has received for processing by the listener. When processing a
		notification, the listener then checks whether it has already
		processed the product, effectively requeuing any products that may
		have failed to process on the first attempt.</p>

	<h3>maxTries and retryDelay</h3>
	<p>maxTries and retryDelay settings control how a listener handles
		notifications that fail to process on the first attempt; and ensure a
		notification is processed without requiring a process restart.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>maxTries</dt>
		<dd>defines the number of delivery attempts PDL should make for a
			specific listener; and defaults to 1.</dd>
		<dt>retryDelay</dt>
		<dd>defines how many milliseconds to wait between delivery
			attempts that fail; and defaults to 300000ms (5 minutes).</dd>
	</dl>

	<h2>Configuration Example</h2>
	<p>The lines in bold below show an example of how these properties
		can be added to a listener. In general, any type of listener can
		configure these properties.</p>
	<pre>
[LISTENERNAME]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ExternalNotificationListener
command = /bin/echo
includeTypes = origin
<strong>listenerIndexFile = data/LISTENERNAME_listener.db
maxTries = 3
retryDelay = 300000</strong>
