<h1>EIDS Output Wedge Documentation</h1>
<p><a href="receiving.html">&laquo; Back to Receiving Documentation</a></p>


<p>The EIDS Output Wedge provides backward compatibility for EIDS
clients to receive EQXML/CUBE from PDL. If you are just starting with
PDL, it is recommended you use the ExternalIndexerListener or
ExternalNotificationListener interfaces instead.</p>



<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>This is a complete configuration example.
Notice that "eidsoutputwedge" is included in the listeners list, 
and in the section [eidsoutputwedge] the outputFormat is configured as cube.txt.
</p>

<div class="code"><pre>
;; EIDS Output Wedge Config
mainclass = gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ProductClient



; comma separated list of listener names, 
; name corresponds to [name] section below.
listeners = eidsoutputwedge

; comma separated list of receiver names
receivers = receiver_pdl



;; LOGGING

; one of SEVERE, WARNING, INFO, CONFIG, FINE, FINER, FINEST
loglevel = CONFIG

; directory where log files are written
logdirectory = log

; whether to redirect console output
redirectconsole = false



;; TRACKER
;; The tracker provides centralized tracking.
;; Tracker updates are only sent from this computer when enableTracker is "true"

; whether to send tracker updates from this computer
enableTracker = false



; this can be repeated by creating a new section (with a different name)
; adding the section name to the listeners list above, and changing the directory 
; and outputFormat

[eidsoutputwedge]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.eids.EIDSOutputWedge
directory = outputdir
tempDirectory = temp
#outputFormat = quakeml.xml
outputFormat = cube.txt
#outputFormat = eqxml.xml



## most clients use this receiver
[receiver_pdl]
type = gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.EIDSNotificationReceiver
storageDirectory = data/receiver_storage
indexFile = data/receiver_index.db
trackingfile = data/receiver_pdl_tracking.dat
; the eids server(s) to connect
serverHost = prod01-pdl01.cr.usgs.gov
serverPort = 39977
alternateServers = prod02-pdl01.cr.usgs.gov
; these help minimize internal disk usage, and do not affect output directories
; how long to wait before checking for expired products
; 900000 milliseconds = 15 minutes
cleanupInterval = 900000
; how old products are before considered expired
storageage = 900000
