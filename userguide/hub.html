	<ul>
		<li><a href="install.html#requirements">PDL System
				Requirements</a></li>
		<li>EIDS Server</li>
		<li>HTTP Server<br /> <small>These instructions assume
				Apache with mod_alias and mod_deflate are installed.</small></li>
		<li>Linux/Unix Operating System<br /> <small>While this
				is not a requirement, it is a strong recommendation.</small></li>
	</ul>


	<h2 id="firewall">Firewall ports</h2>
	<p>These are the default ports that are required to run a PDL Hub.
		If you use not standard ports, then adjust your rules accordingly.</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>
			Contribute Products<br /> <small>Access to this port can be
				restricted to known senders.</small>
		</dt>
		<dd>TCP 11235 - Senders upload products to this port.</dd>

		<dt>
			Receive Products<br /> <small>Access to these ports can be
				restricted to known clients.</small>
		</dt>
		<dd>TCP 39977, 39988 - Clients receive notifications using EIDS.</dd>
		<dd>TCP 80 - Clients download products using HTTP.</dd>
	</dl>


	<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>

	<p>Before starting installation, determine the following
		information.</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Public IP of server "IP".</li>
		<li>Public hostname of server "FQDN".</li>
		<li>Public hostname of any peer hubs "PEER_FQDN".</li>
		<li>An install directory for components "INSTALL".</li>
	</ul>

	<h3>User Account</h3>
	<p>
		It is recommended run the PDL and EIDS processes in a dedicated
		service account. Additionally, PDL and EIDS are resource hogs and <strong>will</strong>
		exceed default file handle limits. <a
			href="https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Directory_Server/8.2/html/Performance_Tuning_Guide/system-tuning.html#system-shell-settings">These
			can be changed in limits.conf on linux systems</a>. A limit not less than
		65000 open files is recommended.
	</p>

	<h3>PDL</h3>
	<p>
			Download ProductClient.zip from the
			<a href="https://github.com/usgs/pdl/releases">PDL GitHub releases page</a>
			and unzip into the "INSTALL" directory.
	</p>

	<p>
		Any configuration changes require a process restart, which can be done
		using the command
		<code>INSTALL/init.sh restart</code>
		. In a group of several peer hubs, it is recommended that clients
		configure one primary hub, and a list of alternateServers. Then an
		individual hub in the group can be restarted for maintenance and
		clients will automatically fail over to another hub.
	</p>

	<p>Several pieces that must be customized are in bold:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>PEER_FQDN if other peer hubs are being configured; and the
			entire peer_receiver section should be duplicated (with a different
			name) for each peer hub as opposed to adding other servers to the
			alternateServers list. This ensures that if a product is sent to any
			one server in the group, all servers are connected and will receive
			that product. If no peer hubs are desired, remove <code>peer_receiver_1</code>
			from the <code>receivers</code> list and it will not be loaded.
		</li>
		<li>The FQDN in the hub_sender_storage must be configured</li>
		<li>The keychain in the hub_receiver_storage, and individual
			sections for each key must be configured. If other hubs up/down
			stream from this hub will be distributing products, they will also
			need the keys configured because each hub verifies the signature of
			all products distributed before distribution. <a href="sending.html">Additional
				information for Product Keys</a>.

	<p>Note that receiver_storage and hub_sender_storage are
		automatically cleaned up based on configured intervals. Log files
		however are not, and administrators may wish to periodically remove
		old log files.</p>


	<h3>HTTP</h3>
	<p>Add this configuration to your configuration file, to mount the
		data directory at the url in web space. This example uses apache's
		mod_alias and mod_deflate. It is recommended to place this
		configuration in a file "INSTALL/httpd.conf, and then use the apache
		Include directive to include in the primary httpd.conf:</p>
	<div class="code">
		<pre>
Alias /products/ INSTALL/data/htdocs/

&lt;Directory INSTALL/data/htdocs/&gt;
	# allow access to directory for serving products
	Order allow,deny
	Allow from all

	# minimize request overhead
	AllowOverride none
	FileETag None

	# compress products to minimize bandwidth usage
	SetOutputFilter DEFLATE
&lt;/Directory&gt;
</pre>
	</div>

	<h3>EIDS</h3>
	<p>
		Install EIDS into the folder "INSTALL/EIDS". <a
			href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/eids/EIDSInstaller.jar">Download
			the EIDS Server Installer</a> and follow instructions for <a
			href="http://earthquake.usgs.gov/research/software/eids/EIDSInstallerREADME.html#install_server">Installing
			an EIDS Server</a>. If there will be multiple network routes to your eids
		server, read the section "Running an EIDS Server in a NAT
		environment".
	</p>

	<p>In addition to any other installation instructions, configure a
		"CORBA Feeder" by adding this configuration to your servers
		"feeders.xml" configuration file:</p>
	<div class="code">
		<pre>
&lt;!--
CORBA FEEDER.
--&gt;
&lt;QWFeederMod Name=&quot;corba&quot;
		Class=&quot;com.isti.quakewatch.server.QWCorbaFeeder&quot;
		LogFileName=&quot;log/corba.log&quot;
		LogFileLevel=&quot;Info&quot;
		ConsoleLevel=&quot;Debug&quot;&gt;
	&lt;QWFeederSettings&gt;
		feederPortNumber = 38800
	&lt;/QWFeederSettings&gt;
&lt;/QWFeederMod&gt;
</pre>
	</div>

	<p>When the CORBA feeder is unavailable, PDL places notifications
		in a configured polldir; however using CORBA allows pdl to "push"
		notifications into EIDS and eliminates one step of potential latency
		in the distribution process.</p>

	<h4>EIDS Memory Limits</h4>
	<p>EIDS keeps a lot of information in memory, and has been known to
		exceed default java heap sizes. You can modify the EIDS
		server_init.sh, or PDL init.sh, script (when the processes aren't
		running), and allocate more than the default memory using custom java
		heap size arguments. These limits vary system to system, but these may
		be useful starting points:</p>
	<dl>
		<dt>EIDS ISTINotifServer.jar</dt>
		<dd>-Xms512m -Xmx1024m</dd>
		<dt>EIDS QWServer.jar</dt>
		<dd>-Xms1024m -Xmx2048m</dd>
	</dl>


	<h2 id="crontab">Automatic restart after system reboot</h2>
	<p>
		The <a
			href="https://usgs.github.io/pdl/userguide/install.html#crontab">PDL
			User Guide Install Instructions</a> describe how to automatically restart
		the PDL process after system reboot. EIDS processes can be started
		similarly, using its init script at "INSTALL/EIDS/server_init.sh".
		HTTP should be managed using chkconfig, or other Linux style process
		management.
