<h2>Configuring a Listener</h2>

<p>To configure an external notification listener, or an external indexer
listener, follow the steps below:</p>

<ol>
<li>Open the config.ini file in the bin subdirectory of your ProductClient
installation path. (bin/config.ini)</li>
<li>Add a new section with a unique name, placing the section name in
square braces "[]". By convention, the suffix "_exec" is added for a
section defining an external listener.</li>
<li>Under this section you should first define the type of listener
interface that is expected by the external process, either
gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ExternalNotificationListener or
gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ExternalIndexerListener</li>
<li>
	<p>You should then define all of the configuration arguments for
the type of listener selected.</p>
	<p>The storage argument for listeners should be set to a section name
	in this config.ini that sets the storage parameters, not specifically
	to a storage type itself.</p>
	<p>Note: Listeners cannot share the same storage configuration.
</li>
<li>To configure a new storage object for a listener, create a new
section of the config.ini file. By convention, the suffix "_storage" is
added for a section defining a storage object. The storage section
definition for external listeners should always have a type value of
gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.FileProductStorage, and the path should
be the absolute path to the desired root storage directory for the
received products.</li>
<li>When both sections are complete, the section name for the listener
should be added to the listeners value in the config.ini file, separated
by commas.</li>
<li>After editing the config.ini file, restart the ProductClient to load
the new configuration settings.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Config Example</h3>
<pre>
listeners = losspager_exec

[losspager_exec]
type=gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.ExternalNotificationListener
command=/home/www/apps/LossPager/indexer/lossindex.py
storage=losspager_storage
includeTypes=losspager

[losspager_storage]
type=gov.usgs.earthquake.distribution.FileProductStorage
directory=/home/www/data/LossPager/products
</pre>

<h3>ExternalNotificationListener Arguments</h3>

<h4>Configuration Arguments</h4>
<dl>
<dt>command</dt>
<dd>(Required) The command to execute. This must be an executable command and
may include arguments. Any product specific arguments are appended at the end
of command.</dd>

<dt>storage</dt>
<dd>(Required) A directory used to store all products. Each product is
extracted into a separate directory within this directory and is referenced
by the --directory=/path/to/directory argument when command is executed.</dd>

<dd>(Optional) This should be a comma-separated list of product types to
specifically use to trigger this command. Product types not included in
this list will not be sent to this listener. If this is not defined, the
listener will receive all products not specifically excluded with the
configuration below.</dd>

<dt>excludeTypes</dt>
<dd>(Optional) this should be a comma-separated list of product types that
specifically should not be sent to this listener. Product types included in
this list will not be sent to this listener.</dd>
